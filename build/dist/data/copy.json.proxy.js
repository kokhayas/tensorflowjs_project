Currently, Indian farmers can only sell their products in government-controlled markets called 'mandis'. The sales process in mandis is regulated through commission agents (CAs) who mediate between the farmers and traders. Although there is a minimum support price in mandis, the traders and CAs have built cartels where they control prices and speed of payments, with little transparency on the trade process. While this law would allow farmers to sell freely outside of mandis, the law sparked massive protests by farmers around India due to fears of further deregulation and exploitation by corporations.\n\t\tTHS the rise of shareholder activism\n\t\t\tShareholder activism is a way that shareholders can influence a corporation's management by exercising their rights as partial owners.

In a common law system (e.g. US, UK), judges take an active role in shaping the laws. Decisions by the court establish precedent for future cases.

to volunteer for socially utile but undesirable activities in exchange for a lighter sentence (e.g. experimental drug trials, military service, hard labour)\n\t\tThat we prefer a world in which those accused of crimes remain completely anonymous to the public unless they receive a guilty verdict\n\t\tThat we prefer judges to absolutely respect wills rather than intervene to correct perceived inequities\n\tR2\n\t\tThat we prefer sports leagues with fewer teams that have a greater concentration of talented players to leagues with more teams but a greater dilution of talented players\n\t\tThat sporting clubs should be majority-owned by the local communities they represent\n\t\tThat we support strong norms encouraging children to highly prioritise the pursuit of excellence in competitive hobbies (e.g. debating, netball, e-sports)\n\tR3\n\t\tThat we should redraw electoral boundaries to eliminate safe seats/districts as far as possible.\n\t\tThat, as the progressive movement, we would oppose censorship by social media companies (e.g. Spotify and Facebook)\n\t\tThat we should force politicians to entirely rely upon public services during their time in office (e.g. public transport, public housing, public education)\n\tR4\n\t\tThat we should abolish academic tenure\n\t\t\tAcademic tenure is a type of academic appointment in universities where an academic's employment cannot be terminated except in exceptional circumstances (e.g. a crime, a serious breach of duties, the university being unable to pay them). It is usually granted to senior academics.\n\t\tThat we should have distinct teaching professionals teach at universities rather than professors\n\t\t\tProfessors in universities are generally tasked to conduct original research as well as teach at universities. Professors do not need any teaching qualifications but are experts in their field of research.\n\t\tThat we support bonded government scholarships in developing countries.\n\t\t\tBonded scholarship programmes in places like Singapore and Malaysia facilitate the ability of students to study abroad at elite universities. These programs are paid for by the state in return for the student being \"bonded\" to work for the state for a given period of time (3, 5, 10 years). Students may be bonded to specific departments or just bonded in general. It is possible for students to occasionally default on their bond and pay back the cost of education at a large premium.\n\tR5\n\t\tThat democracies should hold elections immediately post-COVID.\n\t\t\t'Post-COVID' refers to a near future where a country no longer bears a likely risk of community transmission. This is generally achieved upon mass circulation of a COVID vaccine.\n\t\tThat, as China, we would impose economic sanctions on Myanmar.\n\t\t\tWhen Myanmar was ruled by the military junta, China was a backer of it in many ways during Western sanctions, including by being the military’s largest arms supplier. However, the military suspected Beijing’s involvement in financing numerous rebel groups in Myanmar, and fears of territorial conflict with China contributed to the junta’s decision to partly democratize in 2011. After Aung San Suu Kyi became State Counselor in 2016, her party, the NLD, cultivated a close relationship with China due to the CCP’s outreach to them, inviting NLD officials on nationwide tours and enabling Myanmar’s participation in the Belt and Road Initiative. In the aftermath of the 2021 coup that deposed Suu Kyi, China has faced significant backlash from the common public in Myanmar due to its unwillingness to condemn the coup like other countries (including the Biden administration, which has signalled an intent to impose economic sanctions).\n\t\tThat states should actively discourage self-segregation of immigrant/ethnic/religious communities\n\tR6\n\t\tThat progressives in Australia should not support the Greens' hung parliament strategy\n\t\t\tA \"hung parliament\" means that no single party has gained a majority of seats at the election and therefore cannot form government without other parties joining them. While common overseas, they are rare in Australia. The Australian Greens recently announced their \"hung parliament strategy\" for the next federal election. The main parts of this strategy include: a) Advocating to voters the benefits of a hung parliament and how it could be likely to oust the Liberal & National Parties from power b) aggressively targetting 9 Lower House seats (5 Labor-held and 4 Liberal-held) in order to gain the balance of power in the Lower House and force a hung parliamentary c) Targetting Labor voters and trying to force the Labor party into minority government with the Greens so they can exert influence on policy\n\t\tThat we, as the Liberal Party, would introduce a meaningful quota for women running in winnable seats\n\t\tThat Australia should give temporary work visa holders the right to vote\n\tOpen Octo-Finals\n\t\tThat the feminist movement should encourage women to avoid feminine linguistic behaviours (e.g. uptalk, low modality language)\n\t\t\tMany linguistic and behavioural tics are considered feminine. These include uptalk, where women speak with a rising inflection, low modality language and heavy! use!! of exclamation points!!! and emojis :)). Career advice for young women often suggests trying to avoid these tics in order to be taken seriously in the workplace and society broadly.\n\t\tThat, as the feminist movement, we would encourage women to reject acts of chivalry (e.g. men buying drinks, holding doors open, \"ladies first\")\n\t\tThat the state should offer a wage to primary domestic caretakers\n\tOpen QF\n\t\tThat the perception of being a 'model minority' has brought more harms than benefits to the Asian diaspora in Western nations\n\t\tThat we would support a dominant narrative in society that there exists a soulmate for everyone\n\t\tThat the government should force all religious charities to strictly avoid religious messaging in their charity activity\n\tOpen SF\n\t\tThat developing nations should introduce policies to heavily discourage the development of monarch cities\n\t\t\t\"Monarch cities\" are cities in which a vast proportion of a nation's capital and economic activity is centralised. Examples include Dublin, Athens, Vienna, Budapest, and Cairo.\n\t\tThat we should abolish Greenfield agreements\n\t\t\tA Greenfield agreement is an agreement made between a union and a new employer, which does not yet have employees. This means that the future employees of that company effectively have no say in the conditions of their employment. Currently, under the Fair Work Act, unions cannot legally take industrial action during the negotiation of Greenfield agreements,\n\t\tThat the Australian government should enact a job guarantee\n\t\t\tA job guarantee is an unconditional job offer at a minimum wage made by the government to anyone willing and able to work.\n\tOpen Finals\n\t\tThat we support the introduction of kakistocratic courts in Western Liberal Democracies.\n\t\t\t\"For the purposes of this debate, a 'kakistocratic court' is a court that determines whether politicians are fit to govern. These courts would operate similarly to, but outside of, existing legal systems. They would only have the power to strip individuals of the right to hold or run for office. They would not be able to issue any other punishments. These courts would not make judgments about an individual's character or competency, but rather would assess on the balance of probabilities whether individuals had committed acts that would disqualify them from the ability to govern. The list of these acts might include currently criminalised behaviour but could also include other acts that are not currently criminalised.\n\t\tThat we regret the existence of war memorial days (e.g. ANZAC Day, Remembrance Day, Vietnam Veterans Day)\n\t\tThat, when dealing with historically dis-privileged groups, we prefer economic reparations (e.g. direct payments, community investment, reappropriation of industry) to political reparations (e.g. additional vote-weighting, quotas in parliament, granting of autonomous control over land)\n","\n","UNSW Easters 2019\n\tOctofinals\n\t\tThat we regret Operation Car Wash\n\t\t\tOperation Car Wash was an extensive investigation into political corruption in Brazil. The investigation uncovered extensive money laundering and bribery at Petrobras, a semi-public Brazilian petrol company. As a result of the investigation the left-leaning Workers' Party lost power, and the President, Dilma Rousseff (also a member of the Workers' Party) was impeached and removed from power. Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician, was elected President in 2018.\n\t\tThat the public should be given the power to pardon/give amnesty to whistleblowers via referendums\n\t\tThat, as a Rohingya Muslim fleeing the Myanmer military, we would join ARSA\n\t\t\tThe Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) emerged in October 2016 when it attacked three police outposts in various townships in Myanmar, killing nine police officers. ARSA says it is fighting on behalf of more than 1 million Rohingya Muslims, who have been denied their most basic rights, includig citizenship. Arsa has armed and safly evacuated a significant number of Rohingya from the stat of Rakhine in Myanmar.\n\t\t\tThe Myanmer authorities, however, say that they are Muslim \"terrorists\" who want to impose Islamic rule. Amnesty International has published reports detailing the massacres and brutalities done by ARSA on the military and townships that strongly support the government.\n","Sydney Easters 2018\n\tRound 1\n\t\tThat Australia should abolish its state governments.\n\t\tThat we should allow binding citizen-initiated plebiscites.\n\t\t\tA binding citizen-initiated plebiscite is a national vote which, if it passes, directly changes the law, without the need for approval by parliament. They are initiated by voters.\n\t\tThat we should appoint the Senate by random lottery.\n\tRound 2\n\t\tThat, when funding or approving research, we should not consider whether it is potentially controversial.\n\t\t\tAcademic research is usually funded by either universities or government research councils. If research is considered likely to be controversial (for example if it relates to areas such as sex differences in intelligence or radical political theory), it may be less likely to receive funding.\n\t\tThat we should abolish all exit rankings of high school students (e.g. the ATAR).\n\t\tThat universities should financially compensate students who have tried, but been unable, to gain employment in a field relevant to their studies within 5 years of graduation.\n\tRound 3\n\t\tThat judges should not consider victim impact statements or character evidence in sentencing.\n\t\tThat we should ban plea bargains in criminal trials.\n\t\t\tA plea bargain is where an accused criminal is offered a more lenient sentence in exchange for pleading guilty and forgoing a trial.\n\t\tThat women around the world should not be taxed.\n\t\t\tUNICEF estimates that women do 66% of the world’s work for less than 10% of its income.\n\tRound 4\n\t\tThat we regret the decline of gaybourhoods.\n\t\t\tGaybourhoods are urban areas with generally recognised boundaries that unofficially form a social centre for LGBT people (eg. Castro in San Francisco, the Greenwich Village in New York, Newtown in Sydney). They are less common and exclusive than has historically been the case.\n\t\tThat, as a parent, we would actively encourage our child to invest in their appearance and physical attractiveness.\n\t\tThat we would prefer a world where sex and love are viewed and conceived of as separate.\n\tRound 5\n\t\tThat charities should not host events that require participants to emulate the experiences of those for whom they are raising money (eg. 40 Hour Famine, CEO Sleep Out, Live Below the Line)\n\t\tThat the Left should use the tactic of doxxing alt-right/nazi sympathisers.\n\t\t\tDoxxing is the practice of publicly exposing an individual’s personal details and/or details of their behaviour.\n\t\tThat we should remove all legal restrictions on the right of workers to strike.\n\t\t\tThere are legal restrictions on the right to strike. They include (but are not limited to) that it is illegal to strike if you are an emergency service worker, if it is not during enterprise bargaining negotiations, if the relevant industrial tribunal has not approved it, and if the strike is in protest of national or state laws regarding workers’ rights or living standards (as compared to your specific workplace). Employees are not paid while on strike.\n\tRound 6\n\t\tThat we should allow doctors to prescribe placebos for the treatment of symptoms without informing their patient that they are placebos.\n\t\t\tPlacebos are imitation versions of a medical treatment, which do not contain the active ingredient or correct procedure of the treatment (for example, a “sugar pill” instead of Paracetamol, the active ingredient in Panadol). They have been shown to psychologically affect a patient, often mimicking the impact of the active ingredient. A symptom is something a patient feels as a result of a condition (eg. pain, anxiety, distress) as opposed to the condition itself (eg. an infection or disease).\n\t\tThat, assuming the players are fully informed of the risk, we support the right of athletes to play violent sports (eg. NFL/GridIron, Boxing).\n\t\tThat we should ban rehabilitation and/or recovery service providers from including religious beliefs as part of their treatment.\n\tOctofinals\n\t\tThat developing nations should adopt near-0% corporate tax rates.\n\t\tThat we should abolish the requirement to prove an ongoing connection to land in Native Title claims.\n\t\t\tNative Title is the legal recognition within the Australian legal system of the traditional rights and interests of Indigenous Australians in land. Native Title is only recognised if the claimant can prove an ‘ongoing connection’ to the land in question. When Native Title is recognised, this does not always result in the relevant Indigenous group being granted land rights or control over that land.\n\t\tThat Western nations which militarily intervene in a state should take a significant number of refugees from that state.\n\tQuarterfinals\n\t\tThat families and/or doctors should be allowed to involuntarily commit individuals that express violent intentions even when they have no other mental health disturbance.\n\t\t\tAt the moment, individuals can only be involuntarily committed to psychiatric care if they have a diagnosed mental health condition and are presenting severe symptoms (eg. suicide risk, mania, extreme delusions.\n\t\tThat we would prefer a world without empathy.\n\t\t\tEmpathy is the emotional response/ability to adopt the feelings and experiences of another. It is not the rational consideration of those things.\n\t\tThat we should refocus history to emphasise the wrong-doings and moral failings of historical figures to an equal or greater extent than their positive contributions.\n\t\t\tThere is extensive evidence that Mahatma Ghandi sexually exploited young women, including his great niece. // Mother Theresa denied medically necessary abortion, likely mismanaged large amounts of money, and allegedly kept patients in pain as “the world gains much from their suffering”. // Winston Churchill directed the British government to export food out of India during the Bengal famine of 1943, in which 3 million Indians died of starvation. // Thomas Jefferson owned slaves and serially raped one of them, Sally Hemings.\n\tSemifinals\n\t\tThat Australia should legalise and reward bounty hunting.\n\t\t\tA bounty hunter is someone who locates and captures criminals and other people accused of crimes, in exchange for a monetary award – a bounty. They are not a member of law enforcement. Bounty hunting is illegal in Australia but legal in some states in the US.\n\t\tThat we should abolish the recidivist premium and provide a sentencing discount to offenders with criminal records.\n\t\t\tMost jurisdictions impose a ‘recidivist premium’ on offenders who have previously committed a crime, which increases the severity and/or length of their sentence.\n\t\tThat we should force symbolic death penalty states to carry out a prisoner’s death sentence at that prisoner’s request.\n\t\t\tNevada has only 1000 prisoners on death row, but has executed only 22 people in the last 40 years. Such states are referred to as ‘symbolic death penalty states’.\n\tGrand Final\n\t\tThat progressives should abandon the rhetoric of the lottery of birth.\n\t\tThat we regret the popularisation of performance and skills previously associated with sex work (eg. Pole Dancing, Burlesque Strip Tease).\n\t\tThat we support the use of violence as a tactic for fighting oppression.\n","Wollongong Easters 2017\n\tRound 1\n\t\tThat, as a socially conservative Coalition Member of Parliament, we would join Cory Bernardi’s Australian Conservatives Party\n\t\tThat, as the Labor Party, we would remove Bill Shorten as the leader before the next Federal election.\n\t\tThat we should implement a quota for Indigenous Australians in Federal Parliament\n\tRound 2\n\t\tThat we support juries returning a verdict of not guilty when they believe the defendant is technically guilty but that a conviction would be unjust\n\t\tThat non-violent crimes committed by a significant proportion of the population (e.g. internet piracy, jaywalking, possession of marijuana, etc.) should be automatically decriminalised\n\t\tThat we regret the rise of shows (eg. Serial, Making a Murderer) that undertake detailed investigations into criminal cases\n\tRound 3\n\t\tThat the Government should tax companies’ use of technology that is replacing human labour\n\t\tThat we should allow young people to opt out of specific protections of workers’ rights when applying for jobs (eg. minimum wage, maximum working hours, penalty rates)\n\t\tThat the Australian Government should focus on increasing accessibility and reliability of rental properties (eg. long-term leases, greater protections for tenants), rather than on the accessibility of home ownership\n\tRound 4\n\t\tThat we regret the argument of identity politics that you only have a politically legitimate position on an issue if you are a member of the affected group\n\t\tThis House

One of the most famous examples was Foreign Ministry of China spokesman Zhao Lijian criticising Australia by sharing an image on Twitter by Chinese cartoonist Wuhe Qilin. The image depicted an Australian soldier holding a bloodstained knife to a child’s throat. The image references Australian warcrimes in Afghanistan, as detailed in the Brereton Report, and its sharing garnered significant global controversy.\n\tR5\n\t\tThis house supports norms and institutions which give significant political power to opposition parties (for example, a norm of bipartisan coalitions, appointment to powerful roles in the Executive)\n\tQF\n\t\tThis house would impose B-Corporation requirements into the governing constitutions of all large companies.\n\t\t\tTo become certified as a \"B-Corporation\", a company must make changes to its governing constitution.

Define \"stakeholders\" as the employees, the community, the environment, suppliers, customers, and shareholders.\n\t\t\t3. Forbid prioritization of one stakeholder over another.\n\t\t\tIf a company acts inconsistently with its governing constitution, interested parties can enforce its provisions through the courts.

Israel's new prime minister, Naftali Bennett was sworn in on Sunday after a vote of confidence with the narrowest of margins; 60 votes to 59. Bennett, the far right leader of Yamina party, will be prime minister until September 2023 as part of a power-sharing deal. He will then hand power over to Yair Lapid, head of the centrist Yesh Atid party, for a further two years. Bennett leads a self-described “government of change” that is a mix of ideologically opposed politicians from the left (Labor), the centre (Lapid), hardline Jewish religious nationalists and a small Arab Islamist party. Bennett has long opposed the two-state solution - and the cessation of military action against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. He is in support of the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\tESL GF\n\t\tThis house believes that journalists who support a Palestinian state should deprioritise Hamas' role in the escalation of the conflict.\n\tNovice GF\n\t\tThis house believes that religious leaders should abandon the use of the narrative of \"test of God\" in religious preachings.\n\t\t\tFor the purpose of this debate, the \"test of god\" refers to the narrative in which religious followers are taught that their difficulties in life (which may include but are not limited to personal struggles, relationship woes, economic difficulties, natural disasters) are tests of God through which their spiritual and emotional strengths are tested.\n\tGF\n\t\tThis house supports the use of ‘right to privacy’ arguments to advance social causes (for example, the decriminalisation of abortion and homosexuality).\n\t\t\t'Right to privacy' arguments assert that the state should not have the ability to interfere in the decisions and actions of individuals.\n","9th Malaysia Debate Open 2018\n\tR1\n\t\tTH, as a Muslim parent in a western society, would teach their children to distrust the members of the majority/mainstream culture.\n\t\tTHS the Dalit communities’ use of violent protest in opposition to the Indian Supreme Court’s ruling on the SC/ST Act.\n\t\t\tThe Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was brought into law to prevent crimes against people belonging to lower castes and tribes in India.

One of the biggest revelations was that the human trafficking death camps had been discovered months earlier, but police only announced the discovery on May 25. The in-depth investigation was sparked by a number of burning, unanswered questions that dogged the team, among them about why the initial discovery of these death camps were kept secret and who gave the order to sanitise and destroy the crime scene and, why. One shocking discovery was that the authorities, particularly the Perlis police, knew the existence of these jungle camps in Wang Kelian in early January 2015, but had allegedly chosen not to do anything about them until half a year later.\n\t\tTH, as a politically liberal party in Malaysia, will reject any offers to enter into existing political coalitions to form a government.\n\t\t\tThe Malaysian Parliament dissolved today and the General Election is expected to be held soon.

The BN, lead by PM Najib Razak has historically held majority seats on the parliament since Malaysia’s independence in 1957. The government formed by the BN has had allegations of corruptions and electoral fraud.

On the other side are supporters of the government of President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who was overthrown by the Houthis in early 2015. The war intensified in March 2015 when a coalition of 10 states led by Saudi Arabia launched a campaign of airstrikes against the Houthi-Saleh coalition. Riyadh’s declared objectives are to roll back the Houthis and reinstate Hadi. The Houthis are reportedly an Iranian proxy, leading the intervention to be framed as an effort to counter Iran’s influence.

2021\n\tR1\n\t\tA: That we support this trend in progressive discourse. (Progressive Discourse)\n\t\t\tIn progressive discourse, there is a trend to defend behaviours and norms on the grounds that all of the participants have consented (for example, in defences of the production and consumption of pornography).\n\t\tB: That we regret the trend of describing regressive views or speech as violent. (Violent Views)\n\t\tC: That, as a new media company, we would choose to have a cohesive voice without consistent attribution of any particular writers (for example, the Economist) rather than individuals writers having their own independent, recognisable voices (for example, the Atlantic) (Writer Attribution)\n\tR2\n\t\tA: That we, as the judge, would rule the crack down legal. (Legal Crackdown)\n\t\t\tYou are a judge in a country with an established democracy, but which has experienced a weakening of its democratic institutions. The Parliament has passed an unconstitutional bill with popular support declaring martial law and repealing all statutory guarantees for elections. The legality of this has gone to court. You have the deciding vote in this case.\n\t\tB: That, as New Zealand, we would refuse to extradite Mr Kim to China. (Kyung Yup Kim)\n\t\t\tKyung Yup Kim is a 46-year-old New Zealand permanent resident, having moved to New Zealand from Korea at the age of 16. There is strong forensic and circumstantial evidence linking Mr Kim to the recent murder in China of a Chinese woman, and he has been arrested and detained by the New Zealand police on the strength of that evidence. China has requested that New Zealand extradite Mr Kim to China, and has guaranteed that Mr Kim will not be executed should he be found guilty. China is also New Zealand's largest trade partner. However, China's courts and prison system have been often criticised as arbitrary and inhumane.\n\t\tC: That we would allow a substantially lower minimum wage for prisoner labour. (Prisoner Labour)\n\tR3\n\t\tA: That we prefer the separate model to the concurrent model of women's sports. (Women's Sports)\n\t\t\tA: There are broadly two models of women's sport. The first is the separate model, where women's seasons run at a completely separate time to the men's seasons. Examples include the men's and women's Australian Football League and Big Bash League.\n\t\t\tThe second model is the concurrent model, where all/the majority of women's and men's games happening one after the other at the same ground on the same day. Examples include the HockeyOne League in Australia.\n\t\tB: That student sports should be completely de-professionalised. (Student Sports)\n\t\t\tB: Deprofessionalising student sports may include barring all staff including coaches and associated administrators from receiving more than a living wage, pooling all revenue in the league to cover reasonable costs, and donating any profit to a range of non-sports charities.\n\t\tC: That sports players should not be punished by sports leagues or clubs for private acts that are not illegal, but may be considered immoral by society (e.g. extra-marital affairs etc.) (Private Sports)\n\tR4\n\t\tA: That NATO should vote to expel Turkey. (Expel Turkey)\n\t\t\tA: Turkey is a member of NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, a collective defence agreement. In recent years, Turkey has deepened its relationship with Russia, including purchasing missile systems from them, in addition to other acts which have created tensions between Turkey and some other NATO members.\n\t\tB: That, if the final Noumea Accord referendum fails, New Caledonia should not conduct regular referenda on independence. (Caledonian Independence)\n\t\t\tB: New Caledonia is a set of islands in the Pacific and is currently a part of France. The Noumea Accord is an agreement between France and New Caledonia which provides for up to three referendums on New Caledonian self-determination. The first in 2018 and the second in 2020 were both won by “loyalists” who voted to remain a part of France. The first two referendums showed 43.3 percent support for independence in 2018 and 46.7 percent support in 2020. A \"third referendum\" has been held, but it was heavily disrupted by Covid-19 and it is expected that a make up Noumea Accord referendum will be held once the pandemic has subsided. The pro-independence faction is pushing for regular referendums to be continued to be held regardless of the result of the make up referendum.\n\t\tC: That it is in the best interests of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to quietly abandon its attempt to reunify with Taiwan. (Taiwan Reunification)\n\tR5\n\t\tA: That we prefer a world where god judges people on the purity of their intentions, rather than the consequences of their actions. (God's Judgment)\n\t\t\tA: In both worlds, people are aware of god's method of judgment.\n\t\tB: That we prefer a world where hypocrisy is completely de-stigmatised. (De-stigmatising Hypocrisy)\n\t\t\tB: For the purpose of this debate, hypocrisy means to act in a way that is inconsistent with your publicly stated positions and values. The inconsistency between action and position is key - hypocrisy is perceived as a moral flaw above mere dishonesty about one’s beliefs or the performance of immoral acts.\n\t\tC: That we oppose self help narratives that instruct people to reduce their reliance on external validation. (Self-Validation)\n\tR6\n\t\tA: That we support a rise in income-selective dating apps. (Income-Selective Dating)\n\t\t\tA: Income-selective dating apps require people to verify that they have a certain level of income or wealth in order to sign up to the app.\n\t\tB: That we support the commodification of close and intimate relationships. (Commodifying Relationships)\n\t\t\tB: Commodification is the transformation of things that normally exist outside the market into commodities or objects of trade. Commodification of intimacy includes but is not limited to hiring actors to play your family members; commercial hugging; rent-a-girlfriend.\n\t\tC: That, in a world where both men and women were equally likely to do it, we would prefer a return to the norm of families in which one parent works and the other remains at home. (Parental Roles)\n\tR7\n\t\tA: That we, as Belarus, regret manufacturing the border crisis with Poland. (Belarus v. Poland)\n\t\t\tA: Belarus has artificially created a border crisis with Poland by bringing in a significant number of migrants and asylum seekers – mostly from the Middle East – and taking them to the border with promises of an easy crossing into the European Union. Poland is a member of the European Union while Belarus is not\n\t\tB: That Western powers should pressure Ethiopia to allow Tigray to secede. (Ethiopia v. Tigray)\n\t\t\tB: Tigray is a region of Ethiopia. The Tigray People's Liberation Front is a political party with a military wing from the region which dominated Ethiopian national politics for decades. The TPLF had been in conflict with the federal Ethiopian government over proposed political reforms, and the postponement of the federal election. In response, Tigray held its own elections, and the Tigrayan and federal governments each deemed the other illegitimate. Military conflict began in Tigray in November 2020 after Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed sent troops to topple the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which dominated national politics before he took office in 2018.\n\t\t\tThis troop movement was allegedly in response to TPLF attacks on federal army camps. Government forces drove the TPLF from Tigray's cities and towns, but the rebels retook most of the region, including its capital, Mekele, by late June.\n\t\t\tThe war has soured relations between Ethiopia and Western powers, including the United States, long a critical ally.\n\t\tC: That countries should never cooperate with Chinese \"hostage diplomacy\" (Hostages v. China)\n\t\t\tC: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are two Canadians who were detained by China (allegedly on charges of espionage) shortly after Canada’s arrest of the Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou. They were released after Meng Wanzhou was released in a deal with American prosecutors. This is widely percieved to have been an example of \"hostage diplomacy\", where a country's citizens are taken hostage as a way to exert pressure.\n\tR8\n\t\tA: That China should walk back its crack down on private education. (Chinese Education)\n\t\t\tA: China has recently cracked down sharply on private tutoring companies, forcing these companies to register as non-profit organisations, banning approvals for new companies, and making it illegal for them to receive foreign investment.\n\t\tB: That education systems should actively teach \"Sticking it to the man\". (Sticking It To The Man)\n\t\t\tB: \"Sticking it to the man\" is an anarchic/punk sentiment of the 80s, which encouraged the youth to be politically aware, question and undermine political authority.\n\t\tC: That small or developing countries should replace their school curriculums with a well-performing curriculum of another country. (Foreign Curriculum)\n\tPartial Double Octofinals\n\t\tA: That, as a mid-tier CCP official in a regional government openly opposed to Xi Jinping's property tax plan, we would obstruct rather than facilitate its implementation. (Xi's Property)\n\t\t\tA: Local governments in China rely on land sales for at least 40% of their revenues. This has encouraged an aggressive sales policy, aided and abetted by property developers who have taken on heavy debts to buy the land and build large numbers apartment blocks for buyers who believe that the sector will continue to grow and provide them with capital gains on their investment.\n\t\t\tTo curb what he perceives as excessive real-estate investment, Xi Jinping has announced a series of property tax pilot programs across different cities in China. These property taxes make it more expensive to own property, decreasing its attractiveness as an investment. This policy has seen significant opposition from local and regional governments.\n\t\tB: That we regret the rise of retail investment. (Retail Investment)\n\t\t\tB: Applications such as Robinhood have recently made it significantly easier for private individuals to invest in specific stocks and financial instruments. People use the app to purchase those stocks and financial instruments hoping the value will increase and they will turn a profit. This type of person is known as a \"retail investor\".\n\t\tC: That we prefer a world without corporate tax.

Fahrenheit 451)\n\t\t\tA: A writer has just written one of the great works of dystopian fiction. They have two endings in mind. In one ending, the system prevails and the protagonist is consumed (for instance, in 1984, Winston's forbidden love for Julia is extinguished and he accepts Big Brother). In the other ending, the protagonist brings down the system and the seeds of a new society are sown (for instance, in Farenheit 451, Montag escapes and the dystopian city is destroyed).\n\t\tC: That we regret the increasing number of movies made from existing intellectual property. (Existing IP Movies)\n\tOctofinals\n\t\tA: That we would ban the use of any reproductive technology (e.g. abortion, embryo selection) which alters the prevalence of any common disability (Prevalence Technology)\n\t\t\tA: Prevalence describes how common a trait or medical condition is in the population.\n\t\tB: That we regret the trend of left-wing media coverage of the deaths of individual prominent anti-vax activists from COVID-19. (Anti-Vax Coverage)\n\t\tC: That, after receiving professional and science-based medical advice, patients should have the right to undergo treatments that are contrary to that advice and have not received regulatory approval for that usage (for instance, Ivermectin for Covid-19) (Contrary Treatments)\n\tQuarterfinals\n\t\tB: That, as a skilled worker, we would prefer a world where polywork was the norm.

In response, Pakistan has increased its economic relationship with China.\n\t\tC: That it is in the interests of the EU to lift sanctions against the Taliban regime (EU v. Taliban)\n\tSemifinals\n\t\tA: That, in contexts where significant sectarian violence has recently given way to a increasingly stable unity government, we oppose measures that increase the public's awareness of the scale and details of atrocities (for instance, publishing evidence-gathering reports, Truth and Reconciliation Commissions).

Examples are dyslexia (impediment on a person’s ability to read and comprehend a text) and ADHD (Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder).\n\t\tThat we regret the norm that doctors should defer to their patients' wishes, even where doing so is not in those patients' best interests.\n\tR2\n\t\tThat we support gamification in the workplace.\n\t\t\tGamification is the application of game-design elements and game principles (e.g. point scoring, competition with others, rules of play) in non-game contexts.\n\t\tThat the government should provide incentives for the urban poor to migrate to rural areas.\n\t\t\tThe ‘urban poor’ refers to individuals or families in urban areas with incomes below the poverty line.\n\t\tThat the #MeToo movement has failed working class women.\n\t\t\tThe #MeToo movement is a movement against sexual harassment and sexual abuse where people publicise their allegations of sex crimes committed by powerful and/or prominent men.\n\tR3\n\t\tThat we would abolish the ‘one-year-out’ rule in the NBA.\n\t\t\tThe ‘one-year-out’ rule requires prospective NBA (National Basketball Association) players to take a gap year after graduating from high school before they can be drafted or play in the NBA. Most players choose to spend this gap year at college playing amateur basketball, although some choose to spend a year playing in overseas professional leagues.\n\t\tThat we prefer a world where sports are not commercialised.\n\t\tThat we regret the ongoing prominence of cricket in postcolonial countries.\n\tR4\n\t\tThat we, as Benny Gantz, regret signing the coalition agreement between Likud and the Blue and White alliance.\n\t\t\tBlue and White is a centre to centre-left political alliance in Israel, led by Benny Gantz. Following Knesset (the Israeli Parliament) elections held in March 2020, Blue and White entered into a coalition agreement with Likud, the party of current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, resulting in the formation of a unity government. Among the terms of the agreement are the stipulation that Netanyahu will serve as Prime Minister of Israel until October 2021, at which point Gantz will assume the position.  The March 2020 elections were the third in a series of Knesset elections which began in April 2019. Following the first two elections, neither of the two major parties (i.e. Blue and White and Likud) were able to form government, leading to the dissolution of the Knesset and the calling of snap elections. Following the signing of the coalition agreement, two of the parties which made up Blue and White left the alliance, leaving the Israel Resilience Party as the only remaining party. As a result, Blue and White now only controls 14 out of the 120 seats in the Knesset, compared to the 33 seats which it won in the March 2020 elections.\n\t\tThat we regret the Trump-Taliban peace deal agreement.\n\t\t\tThe Trump-Taliban peace deal is an agreement made by the United States (US) and Taliban forces in Afghanistan. The US and allies (like NATO) promise to withdraw their forces from the region by 2021 and remove sanctions against the Taliban if they fulfil their end of the deal, which includes: conducting prisoner swap between Taliban prisoners and the Afghan security forces’ prisoners; and agreeing to not allow parties that pose a threat to US & allies' security (e.g. al-Qaeda or any other extremist groups) to operate in areas under Taliban control.\n\t\tThat Palestinians should abandon their claim for statehood and opt for a civil rights struggle instead.\n\tR5\n\t\tThat we support a permanent move to online tertiary education.\n\t\tThat we would proportionately subsidise (e.g. scholarship and funding) university courses according to the employability of their graduates.\n\t\tThat we regret the expectation that children should be shielded from all forms of danger.\n\tR6\n\t\tThat the Democratic Party should not embrace 'Never Trump' Republicans.\n\t\t\t‘Never Trump Republicans’ are a group of prominent Republicans or conservatives who have announced their opposition to Donald Trump as the Republican Party nominee for President.\n\t\tThat legislative bodies (e.g. parliament, congress, senate, councils) should be formed by sortition democracy.\n\t\t\tSortition democracy, or the random selection of government officials, is the use of random selection from the populace at large to form voting bodies or fill political positions. In this system, the selection can be modified to match the socioeconomic and demographic profile of the country in question (e.g. 50% of those selected may be women if half of the population of the country is women).\n\t\tThat young people should reject traditionally empowered political parties.\n\t\t\t‘Traditionally empowered political parties’ are political parties that have historically enjoyed positions of power (i.e. being the government, holding a majority of seats in parliament) more than any other political parties in that country. Examples are the Republican and Democratic Parties in the US, People's Action Party in Singapore, the Perikatan Nasional (previously known as Barisan Nasional) and the Pakatan Harapan coalitions in Malaysia.\n\tR7\n\t\tThat we should ban mortgage-based financial derivatives.\n\t\t\tA mortgage-based financial derivative (e.g. mortgage-backed securities) is a type of financial asset whose value is derived from a mortgage or collection of mortgages. The owner of a mortgage-backed security is entitled to both the principal and the interest payments made on the relevant mortgage(s).\n\t\tThat we should limit the trading of individual shares and derivative products to licensed professionals.\n\t\t\tA derivative is a financial security with a value that is derived from an underlying asset or group of assets. Examples are options and futures.\n\t\tThat we should ban high-frequency trading.\n\t\t\tHigh-frequency trading (\"HFT\") is a form of financial trading which uses financial data, electronic trading tools, and computer algorithms in order to process vast quantities of information and conduct trades at a much faster rate than human traders are capable of. An average HFT firm might be able to move in and out of a position (e.g. by purchasing and selling particular assets) in seconds, or even fractions of a second.\n\tR8\n\t\tThat we prefer a world where social media networking sites are only available on a paid subscription basis.\n\t\tThat social media companies should aggressively censor offensive and discriminatory content.\n\t\tThat we should ban mergers and acquisitions of mass media companies.\n\t\t\tMergers and acquisitions are transactions in which the ownership of companies, other business organizations, or their operating units are transferred or consolidated with other entities. Mergers are the combination of two companies to form one, while acquisitions are one company being taken over by the other.\n\tOpen Partial Double-Octofinals\n\t\tThat we, as original producers of non-Western films, would deny Hollywood the right to produce remakes, unless a quota for non-Western actors/actresses is guaranteed.\n\t\tThat we prefer transformative to curatorial fandom.\n\t\t\tCuratorial fandom involves the collection and curation of information about an original work, with a focus on preserving and memorialising details of the work in its original form - for example, through ranking characters or episodes in a series.   Transformative fandom involves the transformation of the original work into new forms, with a focus on finding better ways to relate to the work as an individual - for example, through fan art or fan fiction.\n\t\tThat Disney should remove from circulation cartoons from its history that contain racist caricatures.\n\t\t\tA caricature is a depiction of a person in which certain striking characteristics are exaggerated in order to create a comic or grotesque effect. When applied to a group of people at large, this takes the form of stereotyped portrayals of that group.   Over the years, Disney has released many movies that contain distinctly racist portrayals of racial groups. Most prominently, Song of the South has been widely criticised for racist portrayals of African Americans, Lady and the Tramp contains \"Siamese Cat Song\" - which draws on Asian stereotypes - and Dumbo draws on minstrel-show stereotypes for its crow characters.\n\tESL Octofinals\n\t\tThat we support the creation of children's literature which teaches that people are neither good nor evil.\n\t\tThat we should abolish literary awards (e.g. the Man Booker Prize, the Nobel Prize for Literature).\n\t\tThat we regret the stigmatisation of hedonistic lifestyles.\n\tOpen Octofinals\n\t\tThat, as minorities, we would engage with respectability politics.\n\t\t\tRespectability politics is a set of beliefs holding that conformity to socially acceptable or mainstream standards of appearance and behaviour will lead them into achieving respect and thus getting better treatment from others.\n\t\tThat we would require companies to use absolute blind recruitment.\n\t\t\tAbsolute blind recruitment is the process of removing any and all identification details from candidates' resumes and applications, such as but not limited to your school, gender, religion, and any other socioeconomic background.\n\t\tThat we should stop the practice of requiring community's approval to build houses of worship.\n\tEFL Quarter Finals\n\t\tThat the state should pay reparations to individuals convicted in the past for actions that are no longer recognised as a crime.\n\t\tThat criminal trials should proceed even when the accused is deceased.\n\t\tThat the state's failure to address a pandemic should be considered as a crime against humanity.\n\tESL Quarterfinals\n\t\tThat non-Western LGBTQ activists should reject sex positivity.\n\t\t\tSex positivity is an attitude towards human sexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities as fundamentally healthy and pleasurable, encouraging sexual pleasure and experimentation.\n\t\tThat we regret the belief that individuals possess defined personality traits.\n\t\t\t\"Personality traits\" broadly reflect and summarise individuals' characteristic patterns of thoughts, feelings and behaviours. They are commonly thought to be \"defined\", in the sense of being both stable and consistent: people who are extroverts, for instance, are usually perceived as being likely to be sociable and outgoing across a variety of different situations and over time.\n\t\tThat portrayals of religious deities and prophets in media should receive prior approval from relevant religious authorities.\n\tOpen Quarterfinals\n\t\tThat the European Central Bank should monetise the government deficits of Eurozone countries experiencing financial crises.\n\t\t\tMonetary financing, or the monetisation of government deficits, is a monetary policy whereby a central bank purchases debt directly from that country's government in order to finance a government deficit. This has two effects: it (1) facilitates government spending, and (2) increases the supply of money in an economy.   Monetising government deficits differs from quantitative easing in the sense that the former involves purchasing bonds directly from the government, whereas the latter involves buying bonds and other financial assets on the secondary (i.e. open) market.   The European Central Bank is different to many central banks because it performs the typical functions of a central bank across all countries which use the Euro.\n\t\tThat we should reallocate public investment funds from start-ups to traditional small and medium-sized enterprises.\n\t\t\tA start-up is a company in the first stage of its operations, often being financed by its entrepreneurial founders during the initial starting period.   Small and mid-size enterprises (SMEs) are established businesses that maintain revenues, assets, or a number of employees below a certain size.\n\t\tThat we should allow parents to sell shares in their children’s future income streams.\n\tEFL Semifinals\n\t\tThat it is illegitimate for states to limit immigration unless there is a clear threat to national security.\n\t\tThat we regret the rise of nation-states built around exclusive notions of language, race, and religion.\n\t\tThat developing countries should prioritise the massive construction of infrastructure over the direct provision of high subsidies and social welfare.\n\tESL Semifinals\n\t\tThat, as developing nations, we would prefer to align with China than the United States.\n\t\tThat ASEAN should transform itself into a political union.\n\t\tThat Western companies with a significant number of employees from the Indian diaspora should actively campaign against the caste system.\n\t\t\tThe caste system divides Hindus into rigid hierarchical groups that dictate almost every aspect of Hindu religious and social life. Although it has long been outlawed in India, it is still informally practiced through surnames, marriage and business alliances, and the formation of political parties that cater to caste groups. Caste prejudice and discrimination is also rife within Indian communities abroad, in the United States and other countries.\n\tOpen Semifinals\n\t\tThat we regret narratives which portray human progress as inevitable.\n\t\tThat we regret the emphasis placed on individual rights by social justice movements.\n\t\t\tIndividual rights are rights which can be held and exercised by individuals. Even if such rights are group-differentiated, they remain individual if they can be held and exercised by individuals themselves. For example, same-sex marriage is an individual right because it is held and can be exercised by individual members of the LGBTQ community.   In contrast, group rights are rights which are held and exercised by groups. One example is the right to engage in collective bargaining; a person cannot exercise their right to collectively bargain themselves; they must do so with other people in a group.\n\t\tThat, in countries where military service is mandatory only for men, as self-proclaimed feminist women, we would actively volunteer in the military.\n\tEFL Grand Final\n\t\tThat France should abandon the principle of laïcité.\n\t\t\tLaïcité (pronounced la-ee-si-teh) is a foundational constitutional principle of the modern French Republic which stipulates that religion should not influence political affairs and vice versa. It is reflected in a wide range of both policies and social norms, including a ban on wearing conspicuous religious symbols in public schools; a ban on the provision of government financial support to religious organisations; and a norm that political leaders should refrain from making openly religious remarks.\n\t\tThat activist movements should embrace cancel culture as a tool to promote social change.\n\t\t\tCancel culture refers to the popular practice of withdrawing support (canceling) for public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive.\n\t\tThat it is morally wrong to use subconscious manipulation to nudge citizens towards socially desirable choices.\n\t\t\t‘Nudging’, or Nudge Theory, is a concept in behavioural economics, political theory, and behavioural sciences, which proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behaviour and decision making of groups or individuals.\n\tESL Grand Final\n\t\tThat capitalism is incompatible with racial equality.\n\t\tThat, as a woman of colour living in a majority-white country, we would embrace, compete in and establish national beauty pageants for women of our ethnic heritage.\n\t\tThat we, as a Catholic priest, would actively endorse liberal values that do not align with the Catholic Church.\n\tOpen Grand Final\n\t\tThat, as environmentalists, we would choose a strategy of working closely with corporations.\n\t\tThat we should grant legal personhood to culturally significant features of the natural environment.\n\t\t\tIn law, a legal person is any person or entity that can do the things a person can usually do in law – such as enter into contracts, sue and be sued, own property, and so on. Some legal persons are not people: companies and corporations are \"persons\" legally speaking (they can legally do most of the things an ordinary person can do).\n\t\tThat we support compassionate conservation.\n\t\t\tCompassionate conservation is an interdisciplinary approach which combines the historically separate (and often contradictory) fields of conservation and animal welfare. Among its foundational principles are the notion that conservationists should do no harm and be concerned with the welfare of individual animals. Compassionate conservation therefore opposes the culling of invasive species and other practices which involve causing significant harm to individual animals, and instead supports measures such as reintroducing endangered species to areas without invasive species (e.g. islands) or introducing new species to protect existing ones (e.g. the introduction of dogs to Phillip Island, Australia, to protect the local penguin population from wild foxes).\n","Bali Australs 2019\n\tR1\n\t\tThat the United States should adopt a single payer insurance scheme instead of offering a public option in the private insurance market.\n\t\t\tSingle-payer is a more general term used to describe a government-funded and run system in which everyone gets health care from one insurer. The ‘public option’ is a proposal to create a government-run health insurance agency that would compete with other private health insurance companies within the United States.\n\t\tThat progressive politicians in the United States should boycott Fox News.\n\t\tThat the Democratic party should elect a centrist candidate for the upcoming United States presidential election.\n\tR2\n\t\tThat we should use predictive data to assess the age at which individuals should qualify for retirement pension payments, rather than a standardised retirement age.\n\t\t\tData about their type of occupation, age, gender, and the health status of individuals can be regularly updated and used to predict when they are likely to be no longer physically capable of working.\n\t\tThat we support greater restrictions on migrants’ access to civic rights (welfare, healthcare, voting rights, etc.) in exchange for more open immigration.\n\t\tThat we should allow parents to raise babies behind bars.\n\tR3\n\t\tThat the international community should recognize Somaliland as an independent and sovereign nation.\n\t\tThat, as Sudan’s Transitional Military Council (TMC), we would hand Omar al-Bashir over to the International Criminal Court.\n\t\t\tThousands of protesters took to the streets of Sudan in December 2018 and protests are still ongoing. It led to the removal of Omar al-Bashir from power, who had ruled Sudan with an iron fist for 3 decades. The Transitional Military Council (TMC) was set up, which promised elections in around a year. However, most of the protesters are not satisfied, and have continued to protest because they want an immediate transition to civilian rule. The TMC ‘arrested’ Omar al-Bashir, but he has been kept in very comfortable conditions and protesters suspect it is just a ruse.\n\t\tAssuming the Sudanese civilians manage to take power from the military, That the new civilian government should revert to its pre-1970 flag.\n\t\t\tThe current flag of Sudan was adopted on 20 May 1970. The flag is based on the Arab Liberation Flag shared by Egypt, Iraq, Syria and Yemen that uses a subset of the Pan-Arab colours, symbolising a shift towards Pan-Arabism. Prior to the 1969 military coup of Gaafar Nimeiry, a blue-yellow-green tricolour design was used. The colours of the flag represented the River Nile (blue), the Sahara (yellow) and farmlands (green). They were chosen as they were neutral between ethnic groups and political parties.\n\tR4\n\t\tThat, as an evangelical conservative leader in a red/swing state, we should endorse a third party candidate (such as Evan McMullan) instead of Donald Trump.\n\t\tThat we regret the commercialisation of cultural/religious festivals.\n\t\tThat you should start a new religion.\n\t\t\tYou live in a patriarchal and conservative society. You believe that the fastest way to get change would be to claim God spoke to you and anoint yourself prophet of a new religion. You have confidence you will amass a strong set of followers. The only way to ensure success however, is to claim that what God said to you is final, and this is the absolute best version of moral laws.\n\tR5\n\t\tThat we should ban the short-selling of shares.\n\t\t\tShorting, or short-selling, is when an investor borrows shares and immediately sells them, hoping he or she can scoop them up later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference.\n\t\tThat we should force large companies to be fully publicly listed.\n\t\tThat self-described ‘socially responsible investors’ should engage in shareholder activism with companies that have poor ethical records rather than excluding them from their portfolios.\n\t\t\tShareholder activism involves engaging with companies in order to positively influence their behaviour.\n\tR6\n\t\tThat we regret the prominent usage of self-deprecating humour by female comedians.\n\t\tThat we support the #OwnVoices campaign that says authors should only write from the perspective of their own lived experiences and stories.\n\t\tThat minority movements should abandon the strategy of ‘reclaiming’ words used as slurs.\n\tR7\n\t\tThat, as an Islamic political party in a democracy (e.g. PAS in Malaysia, National Awakening Party PKB in Indonesia, Jamaat e Islami in Pakistan and Bangladesh) we would abandon an agenda of Islamic political reform and focus instead on provision of social services.\n\t\tThat, as Qatar, we would abandon all attempts to reconcile with the Saudi coalition.\n\t\tThat India should remove Articles 35A and 370 of the Indian Constitution.\n\t\t\tSection 35A of the Indian Constitution gives special protections to the legislature of Indian-controlled Kashmir. Specifically, it allows the legislature of that state to define who is a resident of the state of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and prevent non-residents of the state from acquiring land within the state or settling there. Section 370 of the Constitution gives the state full autonomy from the central government on all issues other than defence, foreign affairs and communications. Together, these two sections make Kashmir functionally autonomous. J&K is the only Muslim-majority state in India.\n\tR8\n\t\tThat we should abolish cash bail and replace it with an algorithmic risk assessment.\n\t\t\t‘Cash bail’ refers to leaving a sum of money with police departments in order to be released from jail after being charged with a crime but before the verdict; if you do not comply with a set of conditions including returning to face the trial, the money is forfeited. If a suspect cannot pay bail they are not released. ‘Algorithmic risk assessment’ is when a formula calculates the probability of a plaintiff’s return to face trial, and only releases them if that probability is above a certain, defined threshold.\n\t\tThat reputational damage should not be a mitigating factor in criminal sentencing.\n\t\tThat we should nationalise all provision of legal services.\n\tOF\n\t\tThat, as China, we would suspend rare earth mineral exports to the United States in response to the trade war.\n\t\tThat, as Hong Kong, we would prefer having remained under British rule rather than reverting to China.\n\t\tThat, as the Chinese Communist Party, we would officially acknowledge and express regret for the Tiananmen massacre.\n\tQF\n\t\tThat social media platforms should be held legally part-liable for hosted content that passes a certain threshold of ‘clout’ (e.g. pageviews).\n\t\tThat we oppose the development of implantable Direct Cortical Interfaces.\n\t\t\tA “”Direct Cortical Interface”” (DCI) is a brain-machine interface that aims to connect humans to computers.

She represented the Workers’ Party (PT), a democratic socialist party responsible for a number of progressive reforms in Brazil such as mass expansion of the country’s welfare system after they took power in 2003. In 2016 she was impeached by parliament on grounds of corruption. At the 2018 elections, Brazil elected Jair Bolsonaro as president.\n\t\tThat we support federalism in the Philippines.\n\t\t\tThe Philippines has 17 administrative regions of various ethnicities and cultures. It is a Christian-majority country, with a small Muslim population. Most Muslims live in parts of Mindanao, Palawan, and the Sulu Archipelago. Currently power is concentrated in the central government. However, there is a strong push towards federalism, allowing the 17 provinces greater autonomy over their respective regions. One of the largest proponents of increased federalism is President Rodrigo Duterte, who made it one of his major campaign promises back in 2016. Some political dynasties, Muslim groups, as well as allies of President Duterte are also in support of federalism.\n\t\tThat parliamentary democracies should have an upper house with randomly selected citizens.\n\t\t\tAn upper house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller and often has more restricted power than the lower house.\n\tGF\n\t\tThat we regret the belief that there is inherent value in martyrdom.\n\t\tThat we regret the norm of parents financially supporting their children after they become adults.\n\t\tThat we regret the vilification of communism.\n\tESL GF\n\t\tThat the ICC should abolish the principle of complementarity.\n\t\t\tThe principle of complementarity means that the International Criminal Court(ICC) will only prosecute an individual if states are unwilling or unable to prosecute. Therefore, if legitimate national investigations or proceedings into crimes have taken place or are ongoing, the Court will not initiate proceedings. This principle applies regardless of the outcome of national proceedings. Even if an investigation is closed without any criminal charges being filed or if an accused person is acquitted by a national court, the Court will not prosecute an individual for the crime in question so long as it is satisfied that the national proceedings were legitimate.\n\t\tThat we should abolish the Common Agricultural Policy.\n\t\t\tThe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is the agricultural policy of the European Union.

It can also be collectively pooled and used for social welfare projects by the government.\n\t\tThat we support governments using social impact bonds to address social problems.\n\t\t\tA Social Impact Bond is a funding model where governments arrange for private investors to fund a service provider to solve a social problem. The government only repays the investors if the project is successful. Metrics for success are set out in the original contract. If successful, the government repays the investors’ upfront investment plus an additional premium. Examples of social impact bonds include: In the US, Goldman Sachs bought a bond to reduce prisoner recidivism in New York, and will only receive a return if teenage recidivism is reduced by more than 10%. In Australia, the NSW Government arranged for investors to invest in a program that seeks to prevent family breakdown by keeping children in their families, rather than out of home care. The higher the rate of children staying in their families, the more the government repays the investors.\n\t\tThat we should cap the loan limits given by banks to the largest company to 10 times the loan limits given to the smallest company.\n\tR4\n\t\tThat progressives should campaign for the right to polygamous marriage.\n\t\tThat we would prefer a world where everyone is gay.\n\t\tThat women over 50 should be banned from accessing IVF (in-vitro fertilisation) treatment.\n\tR5\n\t\tThat we should abolish village councils in India.\n\t\t\tIndia’s traditional village councils (panchayats) are local self-governance systems that operate in rural villages or remote small-towns.

They function as de-facto courts that adjudicate all disputes (civil and criminal) that arise within these villages and issue punishments at their own discretion.\n\t\tThat countries should impose tariffs on China in retaliation for the Made in China 2025 policy.\n\t\t\tThe Made in China 2025 policy is the Chinese Communist Party’s $US300 billion plan to heavily subsidise emerging manufacturing industries including robotics, autonomous cars, AI, biotech and aviation, in order to make China self sufficient in those sectors. There are also recurring concerns that China is pursuing this policy in part by stealing other countries’ intellectual property.\n\t\tThat, as UMNO, we should maintain our ethno-religious centric political platform.\n\t\t\tUnited Malays National Organisation (UMNO) is Malaysia’s leading Opposition political party.

Oil-rich Libya has been in chaos since the Arab spring movement and NATO bombing campaign that toppled Gaddafi in 2011. Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell, disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014. Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya after election disputes: namely the UN-recognised Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration in the eastern city, which chose General Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA). While the GNA is officially recognised by the UN as Libya’s legitimate government, it holds little power on the ground, and some distrust its Islamist politics. Haftar’s supporters say he is a bulwark against extremism, while others see him as another would-be military dictator. 2. Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya’s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The democratically chosen GNA is backed by the UN and many western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France and Jordan. The recent escalation in fighting comes despite increased international pressure on both sides to return to negotiating a political settlement and to halt the violence over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. The recent loss of al-Watiya airbase dealt a significantly heavy setback for Haftar and will help Turkey expand its air operations in the conflict on behalf of the Tripoli government. The LNA’s foreign backers are likely to step up their support in order to counter a string of Turkish successes since Ankara intervened in January.\n\tGF:\n\t\tTHS Black rights movements in the West's
