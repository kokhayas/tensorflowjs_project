They even tell ou the standard answers to questions raised in interviews, standard 1--2 minites speeches that you do not have to customize to make it original, or even what hairstyle you should have.Sh\u016bkatsu is said to be created by a few very large companies that monopilize the jobhunting and recruiting market, like Recruit Corp and MyNavi Corp.These companies offer sesrvices to allow a client to entirely or partially outsource the recruiting process to them, such as- Providing an online platform for contacting with students, together with providing consultancies on what to say and what contents to put up on the platform to make the client more attractive to students.- Screening out students that have not graduated from prestigious universities, or performed poorly on IQ tests or academic tests that are made by these companies.- Conducting interviews instead of the client, or oroviding the client with consultancies on what to ask in an interview and how the client should score the interviews.At the same time, to students, they approach to the students by- Providing lectures on how to perform well in interviews and tests- Nudging them to start studying about the right company for themselves by attending events and seminars held by the companies from a very early stage",

This kind of revenue model is prevalent among social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. In these cases, businesses pay ad fees to social media sites to have their ads appear. Also, ad fees are often decided by the number of clicks an ad gets (i.e. the more clicks an ad gets, the higher the ad fee becomes), which incentivizes social media sites to target ads to specific individuals based on information the site has collected (e.g. cookies, history of smartphone use etc).",

One shocking discovery was that the authorities, particularly the Perlis police, knew the existence of these jungle camps in Wang Kelian in early January 2015, but had allegedly chosen not to do anything about them until half a year later.",

Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell, disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014. Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya after election disputes: namely the UN-recognised Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration in the eastern city, which chose General Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA). While the GNA is officially recognised by the UN as Libya\u2019s legitimate government, it holds little power on the ground, and some distrust its Islamist politics. Haftar\u2019s supporters say he is a bulwark against extremism, while others see him as another would-be military dictator. 2. Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya\u2019s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The democratically chosen GNA is backed by the UN and many western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France and Jordan. The recent escalation in fighting comes despite increased international pressure on both sides to return to negotiating a political settlement and to halt the violence over concerns about the spread of coronavirus. The recent loss of al-Watiya airbase dealt a significantly heavy setback for Haftar and will help Turkey expand its air operations in the conflict on behalf of the Tripoli government. The LNA\u2019s foreign backers are likely to step up their support in order to counter a string of Turkish successes since Ankara intervened in January.",

Businesses offering rental services are often regulated by federal, state or local authorities; unlicensed indivuduals offering rental services may not be following these regulations or paying the associated costs, giving them an \u201cunfair\u201d advantage that enables them to charge lower prices.Examples of sharing economy platforms are Uber and Airbnb.",
